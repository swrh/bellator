# Bellator

Bellator, in latin, means warrior, soldier, or fighter.

Bellator is supposed to be a simple clone of the Asteroids game released by
Atari in November 1979, but written in Rust using SDL2.

It is being developed and tested in macOS but should also run in Linux and
Windows without much effort.

## Why?

I decided to code this project at first just to learn Rust. I had never written
anything in it, and I liked the idea of writing a game engine from scratch. A
couple of days after I started coding, I decided to make it an Asteroids clone.
